## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Hotel Booking Demand data to better understand:

1. How do I break into the field?
2. What is the best time of year to book a hotel room?
3. What is the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate?
4. How well we predict whether or not a hotel was likely to recieve a disproportionately high number of special requests?

## File Descriptions
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.

All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@nachiket.dixit/hotel-bookings-city-vs-resort-ea52a7c42819).

## Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements
Must give credit to Kaggle for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand).
